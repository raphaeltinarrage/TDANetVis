# TDANetVis

Repository relative to our paper 'TDANetVis: Suggesting temporal resolutions for graph visualization using zigzag persistent homology', RaphaÃ«l Tinarrage, Jean R. Ponciano, Claudio D. G. Linhares, Agma J. M. Traina, and Jorge Poco.

In data analysis, **temporal graphs** constitute a powerful frame-work for modeling dynamic and complex systems. In this context, our work has focused on two questions:
- the automatic suggestion of **resolution**, a crucial parameter at the basis of many analysis techniques,
-  the **visual representation** of the temporal graph, allowing the user to explore the data and detect patterns or anomalies.

We adress both problems from the perspective of Topological Data Analysis, and more specifically zigzag persistent homology.
